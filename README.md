# Betao Periodic Table Assignment

## Introduction

Welcome to the Betao Periodic Table Assignment. This project aims to create a dynamic and interactive periodic table web application. By following this README, you will get a clear understanding of the project requirements, scope, and development workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js
- A code editor (e.g., VSCode)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository_url]
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd periodic-table-assignment
```
3. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Project Overview

### Steps to Follow

1. **Read the README file/description**
   - Understand the requirements.
   - Break down the description into small chunks/sections.
2. **Review an Example**
   - See an example of a periodic table for inspiration and understanding.
3. **Analyze `periodic-table-data.json`**
   - Open and analyze the structure of `periodic-table-data.json` to understand the data you'll work with.
4. **Create Requirements and Scope**
   - Define the project's requirements and scope before starting the development process.

### Work Steps/Flow (End-to-End Approach)

1. **Proof-of-Concept (POC)**
   - Determine the scope of the POC process.
   - Clearly define criteria for success with use cases.
   - Choose the best tech stack for this project.
   - Define all packages/dependencies needed.
   - Define the MVP (v1) for the project and create a prototype.
   - Decide on the best architecture/folder structure and design system.

2. **UI Development**
   - Find the right UI for this project. A reference UI can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/kH7LTf6kzVhwtk1SICCApj/Periodic-Table-(Community)).
   - Create and define a Style-Guide (colors, typography) based on the UI.

3. **Development**
   - Define and create a Sprint Board (Epic, Feature, PBI, Task).
   - Setup a style config for the design system/atomic design based on the UI Style-Guide.
   - Organize and create a folder structure following the atomic approach.
   - Break down the project into small chunks, defining scopes for Epic, Feature, PBI, and Task.
   - Translate/transform UI components to React components.

4. **Testing**
   - Implement unit and integration tests to ensure reliability.

5. **Deployment**
   - Prepare and execute deployment strategy.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure code is well-commented and follows the project's coding conventions.
- Write tests for new features and bug fixes.
- Submit pull requests for review before merging.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
